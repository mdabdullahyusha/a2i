                            <p>“I have created an identity for myself. Today, I am confident, independent, and self-sufficient. People who once frowned at me now look up to me, all thanks to the Digital Center of a2i”. These powerful words are spoken by proud entrepreneur Rani from a local Digital Center. 
                            Orphaned and helpless Fatema, was raised by her relatives who refused to take further responsibilities after she was done with graduation. Unable to provide for herself, Fatema was forced to marry. After years of marriage, her husband left her with two children, throwing Fatema back into the cycle of helplessness that never seemed to leave her. 
                            </p>
                            <p>“I was left on my own with two young children. I had no one I could turn to or seek help from. The ground beneath my feet shifted, and I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders. Except this weight was the responsibility of caring for and raising my two children,” shared an emotional Fatema. </p>
                            <p>On the verge of losing all hope, Fatema learned about the Digital Centres which offer women a chance to become micro-entrepreneurs 
                            cross-subsidizing the mostly free provision of government information and services like birth registration, passport application, digital land services, and so on by charging fees for private services such as rural branchless banking, utility bill payments, computer training, etc. 
                            “I was determined to not be forced into anything ever again. I wanted to carve out my own identity, and take back my power. I knew I had to make sure neither I nor my children were ever in this position again in life. The only way to make sure of it was to make something of myself, and that’s exactly what I did.” 
                                </p>
                            <p>Fatema, with strong willpower and dedication, availed of the Digital Centre training facility. She learned to use the computer and meticulously excelled in her skills. She has now herself become an entrepreneur in one of a2i's Digital Centres, trains people on how to use a computer, and earns roughly USD 290 a month. </p>
                            <p>Digital Centres of a2i are a great step taken to cast the darkness away, especially in the lives of vulnerable women.
